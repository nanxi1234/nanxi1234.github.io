## Information about Helium
At it's core, dactl is a forked version of [sentenza](https://github.com/sentenza/jekyll-material-design) but it has been almost entirely rewritten from scratch.  
I have just started my journey in the world of web development, learning new things on the way.  
Looking for a way to put my newly acquired skills to test I found Jekyll and I quickly realized that it's going to be a good learning experience since I don't like building 'dummy' projects.  
I've built this theme as a way to develop my skills further.
