### Install gems

Run the following to install required gems defined in `Gemfile`:

```
$ bundle install
```

### Customization

Edit `_config.yml` and `_data/me.yml` to tweek the site configuration to your need. See corresponding file's comments for details.

You also should replace the `/favicon.ico` and `/assets/img/me.png` file with your own.

### Run locally

Run `bundle exec serve --watch` to run it locally.

## Blogging

You can begin writting your posts under `/_posts` folder. See [Jekyll doc on posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/).

Posts are automatically grouped under site's post/category and post/tag menu. You can define post's category and tags in the post's [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/), using `category` and `tags` front matter block.

### Series

Sereis are implemented using [Jekyll's collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/). So to add new series, following these steps:

1. Define a new collection in `_config.yml`, under `collections` configuration block

    ```yaml
    collections:
      demo_series:
        output: true
    ```

    Note that to make the change to `_config.yml` take effects, you **need to restart jekyll**.

2. Create the series (aka collection) folder `/_demo_series`. Note that the **folder name begin with `_`**

3. By adding new post under series folder, you add post under the corresponding series

## Deployment

See [Jekyll doc on deployment](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment/)

## That's it

Happy blogging!
