### Setup

There is a [simple setup guide](https://github.com/tsjensen/fuse-core/wiki/Setup-Instructions) which lets you get
a *Fuse Core* based website up and running for free with no web development knowledge.  
If you are a web developer, you may be glad to find that *Fuse Core* has SASS styling and is pretty crisp.

### Credits

*Fuse Core* is visually very similar to [front-cover]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-02-21-front-cover %})
by DashingCode, but internally, it's a complete rewrite with many
[improvements](https://github.com/tsjensen/fuse-core#ancestry). If you liked front-cover, you'll love *Fuse Core*.
