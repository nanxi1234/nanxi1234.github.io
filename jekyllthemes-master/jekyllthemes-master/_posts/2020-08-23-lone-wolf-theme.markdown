Lone Wolf Theme is a simple bootstrap based jekyll theme.
It is infamous for abstracting away the frontend code using [Bootstrap 4][bs4]
and [Bootswatch wrappers][bootswatch] to help us focus on the **content** and
the **functions**.

Since there is no good boostrap based theme for [jekyll][jekyll]
I have created this theme in my free time.
To learn both the web development and contribute to open source softwares.

## Features

- Has 4 unique layouts `home`, `page`, `post` and `archive` posts.
- Bootstrap based theme enhanced further with the Bootswatch wrappers.
- Uses animate.css for animations.
- Uses font awesome 5 for icons.
- Optimized for search engines using [Jekyll Seo Tag][jst] gem.

For more info checkout github repository [manid2/lone-wolf-theme][lwt_git_repo].

Also visit the live [demo][lwt_live_demo] site for the theme.
