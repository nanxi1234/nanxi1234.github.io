Sweet 16 is [Wordpress 2016 theme][2016] rewritten in Jekyll.

This theme is for those who like the visual design of Wordpress but otherwise
want a static site.

This theme is a reaction to content injection vulnerability in Wordpress 4.7.
I've always liked the design of Wordpress default themes.  Wordpress is also
good for muggles but too complex for me.  I've never thought that such
complexity would cause problem until a random French guy injected a spam
article.
