# Pudhina
A simple, minimal [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com) theme for a personal web page and blog, focusing on white space and readability

[Click here](https://knhash.github.io/Pudhina/) to see the theme in action. Note that the download PDF button redirects to 404 due to lack of the file. This is by design, to demonstrate the Glitch effect therein.
